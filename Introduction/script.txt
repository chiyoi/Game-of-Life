# Game of Life: Make a Game with Pixel Art and Chiptune Music
おはよう、ネコです。
This is an introduction about making a tiny retro game with Godot.
Our example is Game of Life,
it is very simple but it covered almost every step of a game project.
では始めよう。

# 1. Idea
The first step is to figure out an idea.
In this game, the basic rule is the well-known
Conway’s Game of Life,
and we just added some little features
so that the player can be involved.

# 2. Art
We prefer to make art assets before building the game.
Our art assets include cells, grids, and the background.
We use Resprite on iPad for drawing,
and we made simple animations for our assets.

We configured the Resprite interface to lovely pink
which is our favorite color,
and the example art came with the Resprite app is so cute.

# 3. Program
Programming is the easiest part of making a game.
We use Godot for the game program,
which is open source and light weight.
Set canvas size to 360 by 180,
drag and drop our art assets,
write some random code with VSCode,
and the game should be ready to go.

The Godot interface is also configured to a lovely pink theme,
and a cute little girl showed up
when installed the background plug-in for our VSCode.
We use GDScript for coding.
Do not put new lines before closing parentheses
so that it looks conforms the Python indent style;
Put double indents for argument lists
so that they have a different indent level with the function body.

# 4. Music
We made music after the game is runnable.
Chiptune style is proper for a pixel art game,
and we use GarageBand for this task.
Connect it to our iPad with Logic Remote opened,
and we are ready to put some random notes.
Do some cleaning after composing,
such as snapping start and end of each notes.

The sounds provided by GarageBand are so good that
some random notes are enough to be our background music.
We love the sounds under “Classics”of “8-Bit Legends”,
especially “Dreams and Visions”.

# 5. Publish
Got a lovely tiny game with pixel art and chiptune music,
we are ready to publish it.
We use itch.io for this process,
and our game is built to run on the web.
Check the “SharedArrayBuffer support”
so that Godot 4 is happy.

Our icon is generated by DALL•E
and we used some colors in it as our theme color.

# Future Work
Our game lacks story.
The game idea made it impossible to have a story,
but story is always the most important part in a game,
we believe.
In our next game if any,
we want it to have a story
that is literary and aesthetically pleasing.

Our soundtracks are too simple.
It is a good idea to first compose the music in score sheet,
with something like MuseScore,
rather than directly make it in the audio workstation.
But our soundtracks are too simple to compose as sheet music.

The web build is too large.
The Godot engine takes tens of mega bytes,
and we want to compress it because we know it is possible.

# 最後に
After the whole process,
we want to make a introduction video for the game,
この動画です。
About how to make this video, that worth another video.
ではご機嫌よう。
